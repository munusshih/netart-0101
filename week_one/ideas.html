            <h1> Project Ideas</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>A multiplayer website that people can add more data into a fun pottery/knotting and save it there
                </li>
                <li>A manifestation about the unionizing designer in Tawiwan. Everyone can see what each other's are reading but stamp on it. (kinda like google doc but better)</li>
                <li>A chatroom as if we're talking on our toilets, you flush if you want to clean the chat (never come back). All emojis are poops and sometimes the message take a while to be sent (very random)
                </li>
                <li>A check in for me and my long distanced boyfriend, we can grow plants together we can do synchronous or asychronous check in through the plant. The plant will die if we don't do anything and threaten us to take of it through email.
                </li>
                <li>A website that made projection the generative message (everyday's different) easier. You don't need madmapper you only need this website and a projector.
                </li>
            </ul>
