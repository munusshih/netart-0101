            <h1 class="game">Why created the game?</h1>
            <p>Taiwan is a country with thousand of years of complex and interesting history, with many colonizers and a crisis of identity building. Yet the nuances often get lost in translation especially when people only focus on its relationship with mainland China. I want to use this game to show how difficult it is to come to an inclusive definition of "Taiwanese" because of the intricate and interesting history the island bears and to show a more nuanced point of view on the politics of identity building happening here.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="game">How did you create the game?</h1>
            <p>It's done in only HTML/CSS. I first by listing all possible definitions of "Taiwanese" that I could think of. Special thanks to Weikai Cheng who helped brainstorm this with me in the middle of the night. Then, we drew a tree diagram that shows what questions should we ask to put each definition to the end of a node, and coded them in HTML/CSS.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="game">Is there anything you feel like could do better?</h1>
            <p>We intentionally shy away from talking about the relationship Taiwan has with China because even though it's a huge part of the current political situation it might lead the losing focus in this game. But it's an interesting history if people want to dive deeper into, for instance, how Taiwan has been taken and given up by different dynasties of China through many wars and resulting in only part of the people living here identifying themselves as Taiwanese/Chinese.
            </p>
            <p>It is also important to acknowledge that I and Weikai's ancestors are both Han immigrants to Taiwan before the civil war. There is this embedded perspective of Han people in our game while there are definitely more nuanced identities and definitions of Taiwanese among indigenous people or other descendants of the settlers that we did not explore here. (Japanese/Dutch etc.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="game">Are there further readings about this?</h1>
            <p>It is sad that there are not that many readings about the identity crisis in defining Taiwanese written in English.
            </p>
            <p>Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_people">whole page</a> explaning the history of Taiwanese identity which maybe helpful!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1 class="game">I have advices, questions or just wanna talk to you!</h1>
            <p>We love to get inputs about this game, the intricate history or identity building of Taiwan, HTML/CSS or just anything you wanna talk about! You can reach me through munusshih@newschool.edu and I will try to get back to you!
