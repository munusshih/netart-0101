            <p>In your idea, anyone can be Taiwanese as long as they think they are. This definition seems to be very inclusive on paper and that is why it is the most commonly used definition by Taiwanese politicians during elections.</p>
            <p class="game">"Anyone who identifies with Taiwan, loves Taiwan, regards Taiwan as their hometown, and is willing to share a destiny with Taiwan, no matter when they have immigrated to Taiwan, they are all Taiwanese, and they are all new and equal citizens after Taiwan's independence." -- Taiwanese Independece Monthly Journal, 1976</p>
            <p>However, the same argument often times be used to exclude people who identify with the "Chinese" nationality by seeing Taiwanese/Chinese identification as a binary thing. Or implying they are not "Taiwanese enough" especially if they support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Unification">Chinese Unification</a></p>
            <p>It has also in history been used to mask the cruel colonial history in Taiwan and hinder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitional_Justice_Commission">transitional justice</a> when not acknowledging the difference between indigenous Taiwanese, immigrated Taiwanese, and settlers.</p>
