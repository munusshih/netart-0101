            <p>In your definition people who are born in Taiwan are considered Taiwanese regardless of their ancestors. It is interesting because Taiwanese laws base citizenship in jus sanguinis (Latin for "right of blood") instead of jus soli (Latin for "right of soil/territory").</p>
            <p>The same definition however could be held against first-generation Taiwanese and other immigrants in Taiwan as they are not "born" here. In history, this argument meant a lot to the Taiwanese people who were born on the island during the Japanese colonial rule and later taken over by the Chinese government ROC and people who fled from China after losing in the civil war. When President Lee Teng-hui became the first democratically elected president in Taiwan, it was an important moment in history given that he was the first president who was born and raised in Taiwan.</p>
