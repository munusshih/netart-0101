            <p>In your definition, people who are born in Taiwan are considered
                Taiwanese regardless of their ancestors. It is interesting
                because Taiwanese laws base citizenship in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a> (Latin
                for "right of blood") instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_soli">jus soli</a> (Latin for "right of
                soil/territory").The same definition however could be held against
                first-generation Taiwanese and other immigrants in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>This argument meant a lot to the Taiwanese
                people who were born on the island during the Japanese colonial
                rule. Some of them thought they would gain independence after the Japanese retreated in World War II, and the Taiwanese Born can finally rule themselves. However, the land was taken over by another foregin government again, the Chinese government Republic of China (ROC), who flee from China after losing in the Chinese civil war.</p>
                <p>Only until 1990 when
                President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Teng-hui">Lee Teng-hui</a>L became the first democratically elected
                president in Taiwan, it was an important moment in history given
                that he was the first president who was born and raised in
                Taiwan.</p>
