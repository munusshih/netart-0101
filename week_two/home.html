            <p>Taiwan is a set of islands in East Asia surrounded by the
                Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and China. While there is an
                overemphasis on its relationship with China, Taiwan has its own
                intricate history. With the majority of the people being
                immigrants and a history of colonization by the Spanish, the
                Deutch, the Chinese, and the Japanese, the identity crisis of
                who gets to be called a "Taiwanese" has always been debatable.

                On this website, you will have to answer several questions about
                what "Taiwnaese" are you referring to when you use the term. You get to leap into the
                complex history and politics of Taiwan while knowing more about
                these islands that the Deutch once called "Formosa", meaning
                beautiful islands.</p>
